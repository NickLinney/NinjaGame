# Ninja Game

## About
NinjaGame is an upload of an older project to create a 2d platforming in Java.

It was a learning project, which began and was halted in 2019.

During the project there was a successful implementation of Canvas and displaying sprites and animations on screen, as well as movement using a KeyListener class.

Difficulties involved problems with collision, and the project was paused indefinitely due to both developers and their other real-life obligations at the time.
